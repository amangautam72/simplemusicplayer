# Music Player (React Native)

## What is the project?

This is a music streaming application I built using react-native for a tutorial that I wrote on my blog. You can play a song through a url.

Actions you can take on the song:

- Play/Pause the song
- Seek the song
- Control the song from lockscreen/notification panel

## How it works

This app uses react-native-track-player to stream music and to control the music from the lock screen/notification panel. The app is manipulated only through react hooks.
